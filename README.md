# Data Science Homework

A small homework project. You will either have received the link here from your
interviewer or you can submit it with your application (reply to application
acknowledgement email).

## Setup and Run

* Have Python3 environment set up
* Install Jupyter Notebook `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Download a [sample dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
* Run `jupyter notebook`


## How to Complete

The exercise is not timed, but we recommend to spend no more than 1-1.5 hour
working on the questions. Don't worry if you can't finish the exercise fully in
that time - just leave a comment what you would've planned on doing.

Once done - do not fork the repo or submit pull request as that would make your
answers visible to other candidates. Instead we recommend you send us the
notebook and an updated `requirements.txt` file (if you updated it).
